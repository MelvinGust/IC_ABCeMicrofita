*Research Proyect - ABC Algorithm in Antennae Optimization*

v1 : Rough implementation of the algorithm based on my understanding of the ABC pseudo-code.
v2 : Rewriting of C algorithm following the C implementation made by Karaboga.
v3 : Inclusion of a Makefile used for automatically compiling the proyect, aswell as the inclusion of a library file containing optimization functions.
v4 : ---

TODO:
- Add compatibility with multidimensional functions and bidimensional functions simultaneously. 
  (This'll be solved by implementing the vector class for xMax and yMax once the code is ported to C++)
- Add capability for finding maxima and minima depending on a configuration.
- Add an output algorithm that places results into a text file.
- Add an interface for function selection
- Test with constrained global optimization problem sets.
